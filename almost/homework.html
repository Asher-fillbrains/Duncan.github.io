    <p>What does the author mean when he says "do Rinehart" <b>Chapter 23 introduces the reader to a new interesting character called Rinehart. He is intriguing in the sense that different people know him for different things. Some take his as a hustler and charming man, others see him as a criminal while others regard his as a reverend. This ability of disguise is what fascinates the narrator after being mistaken for all the above characters. When he approaches Hambro and learns of the brotherhood wanting to sacrifice the people of Harlem, he starts reflecting of how he has become a slave of saying yes to the powerfule people he has met. Mixing his experiences with the ideology of Rinehart, he discovers a new way to solve problems for himself and those around him. In doing so, he would have to do Rinehart; develop hyprocricy. A clear indication of this can be seen in his self talk of "I could agree with Jack without agreeing.........I could tell Harlem to have hope when there was no hope........I would have to move them without being moved." From this self talk, acting Rinehart can be clearly connotated as the next plan for the narrator going forward.</b></p>
